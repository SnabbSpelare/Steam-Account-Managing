# Steam Account Managing
Only with this file can you easily change account in a few seconds and not to worry about remember password if you haven't unchecked for them to be saved with Steam. Make sure you enable password saving for Steam in the settings so you can take full advantage of this with better security! Optional you could use the second version that is just a shortcut on the desktop with your own password and username but that's twice as unsafe.

## Setup requirements
You have to enter in your usernames on the fields. If you have one account you may delete the other field if you want to. But if you require more fields just create them by copying the few lines. Watch this video... To learn how to!
