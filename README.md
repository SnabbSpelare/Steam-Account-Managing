# Steam Account Managing
This is the greatest way to easily switch between a few accounts in seconds! But that's not the best part jet! You do not have to worry about remembering your passwords! As long as you have allowed Steam to save it. Once again to take full advantage of this with better security, make sure you enable password saving for Steam in your settings so you don't have to save it locally. Or else it won't work! It won't be saved in Registry but in a encrypted file. (not encrypted by me) It's also possible to use the second option, which is just a shortcut on the desktop with your own password and account username to login quickly, but this is double the trouble and insecure. So don't do that unless you don't have an internet connection or share your Steam with anyone.

# Requirements
You first have to enter in your usernames on the fields or else it won't work. If you have one account you may delete the other field if you want to. But if you require more fields just create them by copying the few lines. Watch this video... To learn how to!

# FAQs
These aren't really asked qustions but might be?
<pre>
A: How does this work without saving saving a password?
Q: It uses the username you replaced in the batch script and logins into those with the privously entered login details aka "password". I don't see this data and won't be able to recover any lost passwords or backdoor as it's a script not a application. And it's open-source.

A: Doesn't work!
Q: 1. You didn't replace the default made up usernames in the file or 2. you forgot to enable password sharing. If you do not trust me or this way of logging in then don't log out or don't use the script. Simplistic like so!

A: Will this ruin other methods? Will this not work with antiviruses?) AKA. Compatibility Status?
Q: What? No, shouldn't matter as long as it doesn't block the script by some horrible AV company, you should be able to use this and other methods like the second one mention up in the description.

A: Why was this made?
Q: I found it on a forum by searching for a safer way to login to my mutuiple accounts rather than using many shortcuts on my desk.
